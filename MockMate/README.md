# MockMate

## Project Overview
MockMate is an AI-powered interview preparation and mock interview platform. It helps users prepare for job interviews by generating role-specific questions and answers, providing detailed explanations, and offering mock interview sessions with AI feedback and analytics.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose ODM, Atlas Cloud)
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API (Generative AI)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure ✅

### What was accomplished:
- Initialized Git repository and project structure (`client/` and `server/` folders).
- Set up Node.js + Express backend with a test API route (`/api/ping`).
- Set up React frontend using Vite.
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI.
- Configured Vite to proxy API requests to the backend.
- Verified API connection from frontend to backend ("API Test: pong").
- Fixed all compatibility and configuration issues for smooth development.

---

## Phase 2: User Authentication & Security ✅

### What was accomplished:
- Switched backend database from PostgreSQL to MongoDB Atlas for easier integration and cloud access.
- Installed and connected MongoDB using Mongoose ODM.
- Created a Mongoose user model (`User.js`).
- Backend successfully connects to MongoDB Atlas ("MongoDB Atlas connected!" on startup).
- Implemented registration and login endpoints with password hashing and JWT.
- Enabled CORS for frontend-backend communication.
- Built a modular, visually appealing frontend with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Registration and login work from both Postman and the frontend, with JWT-based authentication and protected routes.

## Phase 3: AI-Powered Interview Question Generation ✅

### What was accomplished:
- Integrated Google Gemini API for generating interview questions and answers.
- Created `/api/questions` endpoint that accepts job role and full job description.
- Successfully tested with Postman: users can paste the entire job description from a job posting, and the API generates 5 Q&A pairs.
- API-based architecture allows easy testing and future frontend/mobile integration.

## Phase 6: Analytics & User Dashboard ✅

### What was accomplished:
- Created comprehensive analytics dashboard with performance metrics and visual charts.
- Implemented InterviewSession model for storing detailed mock interview data.
- Built session storage system with metrics computation (response time, confidence scores, topics).
- Added session history tracking with filtering and detailed session views.
- Created performance analytics including total sessions, questions answered, average response times.
- Implemented user progress tracking with 30-day rolling analytics and per-day session counts.
- Built complete analytics workflow: Save Session → View Dashboard → Analyze Performance → Track Progress.

---

## Phase 5: Mock Interview & Voice Input ✅

### What was accomplished:
- Implemented complete mock interview functionality with Web Speech API integration.
- Created microphone test modal to ensure proper audio setup before interviews.
- Built question-by-question interview flow with real-time speech-to-text transcription.
- Integrated AI-powered feedback system that analyzes user responses and provides detailed suggestions.
- Added "Start Mock Test" button in the Q&A generation page for seamless workflow.
- Created comprehensive mock interview component with state management for interview steps.
- Successfully tested the complete workflow: Generate Q&A → Start Mock Test → Voice Interview → AI Feedback.

---

## Phase 4: Enhanced Learning Features ✅

### What was accomplished:
- Frontend integration of "Learn More" and pinning features.
- "Learn More" now provides direct, detailed explanations of concepts (not feedback or review).
- Pinned questions move to the top of the Q&A list in the UI for better visibility.
- Pin/unpin and explanation APIs are fully integrated and tested from both frontend and Postman.

---

## Challenges Faced & Solutions
- **Local MongoDB setup issues:** Faced errors due to missing data directory. Solved by switching to MongoDB Atlas (cloud database).
- **CORS errors:** Frontend requests were blocked by browser. Solved by adding the `cors` middleware to the backend.
- **Frontend-backend integration:** Ensured correct API URLs and enabled CORS for smooth communication.
- **Cloud database migration:** Updated backend to use Atlas connection string and environment variables.
- **OpenAI quota exceeded:** Switched to Google Gemini API for free, reliable LLM access.
- **Prompt engineering:** Refined prompts to Gemini to ensure explanations are direct and educational, not feedback or review.
- **UI/UX:** Improved forms and dashboard with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive look. Implemented logic to move pinned questions to the top of the list for better usability.
